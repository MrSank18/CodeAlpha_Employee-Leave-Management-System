The Employee Leave Management System is a Java application designed to streamline the process of managing employee leave requests within an organization. 
This system allows employees to request leave, managers to approve or reject leave requests, and employees to view their remaining leave balances. 
It provides authentication for users, validation checks, and a simple console-based user interface for interaction.

Key Features:

    Employee Registration: New employees can easily register themselves by providing their username, password, name, and initial leave balance.
    Admin Panel: Administrators have access to a dedicated panel where they can manage employee details, adjust leave balances, and view leave request history.
    Leave Request Management: Employees can submit leave requests, which are then reviewed by administrators for approval or rejection.
    Notification System: Managers and administrators receive notifications via email or messages whenever a leave request is made, ensuring timely response.
    Leave Request History: A complete history of leave requests is maintained, providing insights into past leave patterns and trends.
    Leave Balance Adjustment: Administrators can adjust leave balances for employees, such as adding additional leave days as a reward or for special circumstances.
    Leave Request Validation: The system validates leave requests to ensure that the requested number of days does not exceed the available leave balance, preventing overcommitment.
    Leave Request Cancellation: Employees have the flexibility to cancel their leave requests before they are approved, allowing for changes in plans or unforeseen circumstances.
    Employee Leave Calendar: A visual representation of employee leave schedules is provided on a calendar, facilitating better planning and coordination.
